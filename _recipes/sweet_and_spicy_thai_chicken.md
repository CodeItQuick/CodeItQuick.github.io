# Ingredients

# for the glaze
1. 3/4 cup sweet chili sauce, see note
2. 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
3. 1/4 cup brown sugar
4. 2 tablespoons sriracha
5. 3 teaspoons minced garlic
6. 1/4 cup rice vinegar
7. 3 tablespoons fish sauce
8. 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste, see note
9. 1 tablespoon fresh-squeezed lime juice, about 1 lime
10. 2 tablespoons sesame oil, or toasted sesame oil

# for the picked veggies
1. 1/2 cup rice vinegar
2. 1/2 teaspoon salt
3. 1 tablespoon sugar
4. 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
5. 2 teaspoons minced garlic
6. 1/2 cup shredded carrots
7. 1/2 cucumber, sliced, or shaved into ribbons

# Instructions
## For the pickled veggies

1. Combine all ingredients in a jar. Cover tightly, shake vigorously. Chill
at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
## For the glaze

1. Whisk together all glaze ingredients in a medium bowl. Reserve half of
the glaze and set aside.
1. Add remaining half of the glaze to a medium sauce pan, bring to a boil
and cook for five minutes
1. Remove from heat and allow to cool and thicken while you cook the chicken.

## Stovetop method
1. Combine chicken and reserved glaze in a skillet over medium heat. Cook 5-8 
minutes (depending on the thickness of the chicken pieces).
1. Turn, cook another 5-8 minutes until cooked through. Remove from heat.
1. Top with thickened glaze and serve with cooked white rice and pickled veggies. Enjoy!

## Grill method
1. Combine chicken and reserved glaze. Cover and chill for 30 minutes
2. Preheat grill to medium-low and oil the grates. Use tongs to transfer chicken to
the grill (discard excess glaze marinade) and grill for 5-8 minutes on each side, depending
on the thickness of the chicken.
3. Top with thickened glaze and serve with cooked white rice and pickled veggies. Enjoy!

# Notes
1. For the chicken: If using thicker cuts of chicken (breasts or thighs), you will need to
adjust the cook time by 5-10 minutes until chicken is white throughout and juices run clear
run sliced into.
