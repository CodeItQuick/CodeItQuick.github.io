# Ingredients
* 3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
* 6 ounces fresh green beans, cut into 1 & 1/2-inch pieces or broccoli
* 1 pound lean ground turkey
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* salt and pepper
* 3 scallions, chopped
* toasted sesame seeds
* cooked white rice or lettuce cups, for serving

# Instructions
1. Heat half the sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add in the green
    beans and saute for 3 minutes until crisp-tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate 
    and keep warm.
1. Add the remaining sesame oil to the skillet. Swirl to coat and once hot, add in the ground 
    beef. Brown the turkey, breaking it up into small crumbles with a wooden spoon, until cooked through,
    about 3 minutes.
1. Stir in the garlic and cook for another 20 seconds until fragrant. Drain off the fat.
1. Return green beans to the skillet, along with the brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and chilli
    garlic sauce. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
1. Simmer for 2 more minutes to blend the flavors.
1. Remove from the heat and toss in the scallions.
1. Serve over hot rice or as lettuce cups, with a small sprinkle of sesame seeds.
