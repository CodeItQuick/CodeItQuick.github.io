# YOU WILL NEED
## FOR THE SALAD
3 (15 ounce) cans beans, drained, rinsed, or use 4 1/2 cups cooked beans
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)
1 medium cucumber, finely chopped (about 2 cups)
3 tablespoons drained capers
1/2 cup (60 grams) finely chopped fresh parsley, see notes
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano, see notes

## FOR THE DRESSING
1/4 cup (60 ml) red wine vinegar
1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 to 2 teaspoons honey or maple syrup, optional
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

## DIRECTIONS
Add chopped onions to a small bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside for 5 minutes, drain, and then rinse. This step helps to remove some of the "raw" flavor of the onion
so that it does not overpower the salad.
Meanwhile, in the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, mustard, salt, and pepper. Taste the dressing and then adjust with more salt/pepper. If
the dressing tastes too abrasive, whisk in 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey or maple syrup to balance out the vinegar.

Add the beans, drained onion, cucumber, parsley, capers, and dried oregano. Toss well, cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour to allow the beans to marinate in 
the dressing.

The salad will keep stored in an airtight container in the fridge up to 4 days.
