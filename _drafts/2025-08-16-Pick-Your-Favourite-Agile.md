* Relearning  
* Handoffs  
* Task switching  
* Waiting (delays)  
* Defects
### Activities:  
* TDD/automation (unit/integration/e2e), CI/CD, and feature flags.  
* Refactor continuously; keep code simple and cohesive.  
* Poka-yoke (error-proofing): pre-commit hooks, linters, type checks, guardrails.  
* Pair/mob programming and lightweight code reviews for shared understanding.  
* Stop-the-line (andon) when quality breaks; fix root causes before proceeding.
