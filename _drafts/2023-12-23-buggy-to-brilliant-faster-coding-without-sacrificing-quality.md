# Introduction: The Balance Between Speed and Quality
The key to speed is actually to produce high quality code. The more correct the code is after you write it, the less
rework that needs to happen. Knowing your IDE, automated testing, test first programming, and a safety net all help. Go
fast by being more precise and accurate with your code.

# Common Pitfalls of Coding Too Quickly
The problem with attempting to purely go faster is the tendency to take shortcuts. These shortcuts are frequently not justified.
Activities like skipping tests, and not refactoring can make you go significantly slower in the long run. The code should
be tested on multiple levels similar to the testing pyramid. Both on a high system-level with end to end like testing, and 
on the individual function level with unit tests.

# Master Your Tools and Workflow
# Adopt a Quality-First Mindset
# Automate to Eliminate Errors
# Collaborate to Reduce Rework
