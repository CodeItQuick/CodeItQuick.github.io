I wouldn't say teams scrap a PR. If the developer has worked autonomously for so long, the worst case is it's scrapped. 
But, if it's that far off the point pair programming isn't saving your team! The more likely case "technical debt++"

Misconception; Pairing isn't just about sitting there with someone on your shoulder to watch. Nor is it about sitting 
there like some form of programming puppet with your colleague pulling telling you what to type. It's about collaboration.

"Often, pair programming success looks a lot different. In my case, we pair 1-3 hours a day, and there is often no coding 
involved" Why is this pair programming, is this not just a design session with a colleague?

"After the abject failure of ensemble programming. We hired a couple of developers and began pair programming" So, after 
failing to get 10 developers to group together and code, you added some more developers? What has that got to do with pairing?

I would agree that a benefit of pairing is on-boarding new developers, however there are deeper benefits. Shared understanding 
of the code means that sizing and estimation is better understood. It creates fewer knowledge silos, and can be an effective 
tool for reducing existing silos.
