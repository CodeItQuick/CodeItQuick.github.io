# How to Use User Stories to Drive Product Roadmaps

## Introduction
Stop obsessing over Gantt charts—start obsessing over stories.
Your product roadmap is a garden—user stories are the seeds that actually grow.

## From Vision to Stories: Connecting the Big Picture
Vision
Strategic Theme / Epics
User Stories

Examples:  
Vision: Modern Software that evolves with the times  
Strategic Theme: Modernize the software solution  
Epics:  
1. Upgrade the tech stack: Frameworks, Libraries, and Runtime Environments
2. Upgrade the user experience: Redesign the UI to meet standards, introduce responsive layouts, componentize the UI elements
3. Strengthen Security & Compliance
4. Data & Analytics Modernization: Legacy -> Modern Reporting, Unify Telemetry Management, Refine Logging Info/Warning/Errors
5. Improve CI/CD Pipelines, Automate Testing, IAS
6. Improve Load Times, Response Rates, System Stability, Introduce Monitoring/Alerts/SLOs

Vision (Customer Driven): Provide tools so intuitive they require no manual  
Strategic Theme: Onboarding Without Training, Intelligent Defaults & Automation  
Epics (Onboarding without Training):  
1. Progressive Onboarding  
2. Contextual Guidance  
3. Self-Discovery by Design  
4. First-Use Success  
5. Frictionless Account Setup  

Epics (Intelligent Defaults & Automation):  
1. Smart Defaults  
2. Adaptive Personalization  
3. Automated Workflows  
4. Error Prevention & Recovery  
5. AI-Assisted Guidance  

Innovation & Technology: Bring cutting-edge innovation to industries slowed by legacy tools  
Strategic Theme: Seamless Integration with Legacy Systems  

Some other visions...  
Market Leadership Visions: Integrate with the most modern IoT Platforms  
Empowerment & Enablement: Give every user the power of enterprise-grade tools without complexity.  
Values & Trust-Centric Visions: Stand for ethical technology that improves lives, not exploits them.  
Future & Transformation Visions: Be the partner that helps organizations adapt to change

## Why User Stories Belong on the Roadmap (Not Just the Backlog)

Most roadmaps live at the level of epics, features, or initiatives.  
They outline the “big rocks” — the things executives want to see progress on quarter after quarter.    

| Quarter | Vision          | Strategic Theme             | Epic   | Example User Story                                                               |
|---------| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q1      | Modern Software | Upgrade Tech Stack          | Epic A | *As a dev, I want latest .NET runtime so that I can use new security patches.*   |
| Q1      | Modern Software | Modernize UX                | Epic B | *As a user, I want a responsive layout so that I can seamlessly switch devices.* |
| Q2      | Intuitive Tools | Onboarding Without Training | Epic D | *As a first-time user, I want to be guided through my first key task.*           |
| Q2      | Intuitive Tools | Intelligent Defaults        | Epic F | *As a new customer, I want recommended settings pre-configured.*                 |

## Story Mapping as a Roadmap Tool  

Top Row: User Activities / Journey Steps  
1. Set Up the System  
2. First-Time Use / Onboarding  
3. Daily Workflows  
4. Advanced Use / Scaling  
5. Monitoring & Improvement

## Vertical Stories Under Each Step
1. Set Up the System
* As a developer, I want the latest .NET runtime so that I can use modern libraries securely.
* As an admin, I want the system containerized so deployments are consistent.
* (Later) As an industry user, I want recommended settings preloaded so I can skip manual setup.
