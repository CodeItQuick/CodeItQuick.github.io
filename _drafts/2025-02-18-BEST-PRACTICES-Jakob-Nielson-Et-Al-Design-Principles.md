# Jakob Nielson & Whitney Hess on Basic Design Principles

Although we have dedicated staff for UIUX, the general design principles should be understood by developers.

The one I find missing most often is (1) keep users informed of system status. Implementing (3) is difficult also. 

## Jakob Nielson Original list of 10
1. Keep users informed of system status with constant feedback.
2. Set information in a logical, natural order.
3. Ensure users can easily undo/redo actions.
4. Maintain consistent standards so users know what to do next without learning new toolsets.
5. Prevent errors if possible; wherever you can’t do this, warn users before they commit to actions.
6. Don’t make users remember information – keep options, etc., visible.
7. Make systems flexible so novices and experts can choose to do more or less on them.
8. Design with aesthetics and minimalism in mind – don’t clutter with unnecessary items.
9. Provide plain-language error messages to pinpoint problems and potential solutions.
10. Offer easy-to-search troubleshooting resources, if needed.

## Whitney Hess additions:
1. Don’t interrupt or give users obstacles 
2. Offer few options 
3. Reduce distractions 
4. Group related objects together.
5. Have an easy-to-scan visual hierarchy that reflects users’ needs, with commonly used items handily available.
6. Make things easy to find.
7. Show users where they’ve come from and where they’re headed with signposts/cues.
8. Provide context – show how everything interconnects.
9. Avoid jargon.
10. Make designs efficient and streamlined.
11. Use defaults wisely – when you offer predetermined, well-considered options, you help minimize users’ decisions and increase efficiency.
12. Don’t delay users – ensure quick interface responses.
13. Focus on emotion 
14. Use “less is more” – make everything count in the design. If functional and aesthetic elements don’t add to the user experience, forget them.
15. Be consistent with navigational mechanisms, organizational structure, etc., to make a stable, reliable and predictable design.
16. Create an excellent first impression.
17. Be trustworthy and credible – identify yourself through your design to assure users and eliminate the uncertainty.
