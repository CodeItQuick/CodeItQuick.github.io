# Project Graveyard

A historical take on the kata's and side projects I have worked on since 2021. Built using GithubPages and Ruby's Jekyll. 

Current Active Projects:
1. Learn C through TDDSqlLite
2. Learn .NET/Hexagonal/Testing better through CSharpExpenseReport



Should be on my grids:
extend: {
      gridTemplateColumns: {
        "image-cards": "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(255px, 1fr))",
        "image-cards-mobile": "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(120px, 1fr))",
      },

Current Project Ideas:
1. Something to do with a playlist creator
2. Something to do with requesting music through alexa
3. Learn the C programming language
4. Experiment with streaming from a database
5. Spotify discover playlist/playlist maker tool
6. Tailwind Theme Creator
7. Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down meter for retros

To run theme-creator:
```shell
cd theme-creator
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css
```
