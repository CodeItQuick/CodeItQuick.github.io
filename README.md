# Project Graveyard

## General Description

A historical take on the kata's and side projects I have worked on since 2021. Built using GithubPages and Ruby's Jekyll. 

## Current TODOs

1. Flush out the blog articles more, both in terms of styling md->html, and content
2. Read up more on writing styles and how to write well, and then implement the suggestions in the literature
3. The styling page-to-page is very bland. Make different kinds of cards, and implement different styles throughout the site
4. Get the projects themselves on the internet through digital ocean or something
5. 

## Project Ideas

Current Project Ideas:
1. Something to do with a playlist creator
2. Something to do with requesting music through alexa
3. Learn the C programming language
4. Experiment with streaming from a database
5. Spotify discover playlist/playlist maker tool
6. Tailwind Theme Creator
7. Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down meter for retros
8. Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding_dashboard/)
9. Matter (https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)
