<h1 id="beginner-phase-0---5-years">Beginner Phase (0 -&gt; 5 Years)</h1>

<p>For the first 5 years of my development career I didn’t test anything. Then one day I went to a local devs Meetup, and met JB Rainserberger 
(a well-known author in agile coaching, unit testing and in the ways of TDD). He presented a lot of ideas that very much challenged my ways of
thinking).</p>

<h1 id="learning-phase-5---6-years">Learning Phase (5 -&gt; 6 Years)</h1>

<p><strong>Learning the mechanics of TDD was challenging, so I decided to seek the help of a coach.</strong> I joined two book clubs, JitterTeds, and JB Rainsbergers. Ted began reviewing my
code and I finally got some feedback on code quality. At this point the learning began. It took at least half an hour to write a single test, 
with most tests taking hours to write. I worked on getting more test coverage on side projects, and only worked on testing on side projects as it was too 
much time investment for work code.</p>

<p>My first main takeaway was tests need to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fast (&lt; 10 ms, &lt;150ms if database integration is involved)</li>
  <li>Isolated</li>
  <li>Concise.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this is where I was on the variety of testing topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Acceptance Tests/BDD: No acceptances written as I was currently learning unit tests</li>
  <li>Output of TDD: Higher test coverage is better</li>
  <li>Mechanics of TDD; I could write tests 30 minutes-&gt;hours</li>
  <li>Time invested in TDD: I was only working on unit testing on side projects</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="intermediate-phase-6---85-years">Intermediate Phase (6 -&gt; 8.5 Years)</h1>

<p>During this period, I was able to unit test faster, with most tests being made in seconds to minutes. I could now TDD in new projects that 
hadn’t been developed yet. I started attending a learning ensemble every week. There I learned the mechanics of how to write my tests first,
how to refactor code with unit tests, and how to design tests to be concise. I did plateau during this phase as my learning sources had not
changed in long enough.</p>

<h1 id="collaboration-phase-85---10-years">Collaboration Phase (8.5 -&gt; 10 Years)</h1>

<p>Here, I had new colleagues to challenge my ideas. They had informed opinions on testing, and we disagreed on several topics. Where I am at on a variety 
of testing topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Acceptance Tests/BDD: E2E/Acceptance tests have a place in their part of the testing pyramid. I get requirements, and assurance my software works. Just be careful how many I write.</li>
  <li>Output of TDD: To get better at TDD I need to get better at the <strong>techniques</strong> involved. HOW do I test this, and make the tests faster, and concise, while avoiding any interdependence among them.</li>
  <li>Mechanics of TDD: Significantly easier to write the tests while I code. However, if the codebase is gnarly, I’m going to be writing them after.</li>
  <li>Time Invested in TDD: I only write unit tests if it makes sense from a time and cost perspective. 80-90% of the time I write unit tests, the other 10-20% of the time
it’s not worth the investment.</li>
</ol>
