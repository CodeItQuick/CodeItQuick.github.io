<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I used chatgpt for the first time to explore different topics within database structures. I asked it topics
such as how to build my own SQL/NoSQL database, who are the thought leaders in databases, and what books should 
I read on databases.</p>

<p>TLDR version;<br />
Maybe: Build a simple Database SQL Engine, the NoSql looks way too hard<br />

<h3 id="sql-project-ideas">SQL Project Ideas</h3>

<p>What are the different projects that are useful in building your own SQL database? Luckily, chatgpt comes to the rescue.
The projects can be summarized as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Basic Parser</li>
  <li>Query Execution Engine</li>
  <li>Indexing System</li>
  <li>Transaction Management</li>
  <li>Optimization Techniques</li>
  <li>Concurrency Control</li>
  <li>Persistant Storage</li>
  <li>User Authentication and Authorization</li>
  <li>Error Handling and Logging</li>
  <li>Distributed SQL Engine</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="nosql-project-ideas">NoSQL Project Ideas</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Key-Value Store</li>
  <li>Document Store</li>
  <li>Column-Family Store</li>
  <li>Graph Database</li>
  <li>Time-Series Database</li>
  <li>Distributed Database</li>
  <li>In-Memory Database</li>
  <li>Full-Text Search Engine</li>
  <li>Document Versioning System</li>
  <li>Blockchain-Based Database</li>
  <li>Event Sourcing Database</li>
  <li>Geospatial Database</li>

<h3 id="database-thought-leaders">Database Thought Leaders</h3>

<p>The thought leaders in TDD were pretty disappointing that chatGPT produced, so I would take this list with a grain of salt. However,
here is a list of thought leaders:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Michael Stonebraker: Turing Award Winner</li>
  <li>Codd, Date, Darwen: Rational Model Pioneers</li>
  <li>Jim Gray: Turing Award Winner, SQLServer dude</li>
  <li>Don Chamberlin and Raymond F Boyce: Developed SQL</li>
  <li>Joe Celko: SQL db expert</li>
  <li>CJ Date: prolific author and database theorist</li>
  <li>Jeff Dean: Distributed Systems at Google, dbâ€™s like Bigtable</li>
  <li>Michael R Blaha: Recognized expert</li>
  <li>David DeWitt: Parallel db systems</li>
  <li>Pat Helland: Distributed Systems and Databases</li>
  <li>Hector Garcia-Molina: Stanford Professor, databases</li>
  <li>Stonebraker, Abadi, DeWitt: The AMPLab Pioneers, Apache Spark, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The books by these authors I managed to pull are: <br />
Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques. by Jim Gray, Andreas Reuter<br />
Database Design and Relational Theory: Normal Forms and All That Jazz by CJ Date<br />
Database Systems: The Complete Book by Hector Garcia Molina, Jeffrey Ullman, Jennifer Widom - Standford Professors book, for beginners</p>

<h3 id="sql-server-books">SQL Server Books</h3>

<p>The books I picked up are:</p>

<p>Pro SQL Server Internals (Second Edition)<br />
SQL Server 2022 Query Performance Tuning by Grant Fritchey</p>

<p>TODO: Lookup NoSql Server authors and books</p>

<h3 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h3>

<p>Some good resources include: SQLLite, there is even a (tutorial)[https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/] by the author of SQLLite.
H2 Database Engine is written in java and open source as well. MonetDb is another open source database management system.</p>
