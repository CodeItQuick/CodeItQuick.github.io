<h1 id="shortcutting-your-jetbrains-windows-only">Shortcutting your jetbrains (Windows only)</h1>

<p>Here’s a list of several shortcuts with some explanations of why they are useful. I’ll try
to list them in order of usefulness. There are very few navigation shortcuts in here, and I 
will hopefully make a new post that outlines all the navigation shortcuts that I’m not currently
using.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Shortcut</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shift + F6</td>
      <td>Rename Variable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + P</td>
      <td>List function parameters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Space</td>
      <td>Trigger autocomplete manually</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These are the basic shortcuts everyone should really be using. Rename variable and alt + enter
are probably the most useful. List function parameters is a recent one I’ve learned that is handy a lot.
Autocomplete allows for grabbing methods without having to look at the function itself etc.</p>

<h2 id="dipsy-doodles">Dipsy-Doodles</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Shortcut</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Alt + Up/Down Arrows</td>
      <td>Move line Up/Down</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alt + J</td>
      <td>Grab next occurance of whatever is highlighted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Left/Right Arrows</td>
      <td>Skip to next word</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This set lets you move things around. Alt + J and combined with Ctrl + arrows lets
you skip between things in multiple lines and apply whatever is needed - good for mass editing.
Moving lines up and down is slightly faster than cut/paste and looks a little bit fancier.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring-shortcuts---the-core">Refactoring Shortcuts - The Core</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Shortcut</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Alt + Enter</td>
      <td>Fix some kind of warning/error, Other functionality</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Alt + M</td>
      <td>Extract Method</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Alt + N</td>
      <td>Inline Variable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Alt + V</td>
      <td>Extract Variable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Alt + P</td>
      <td>Extract Parameter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ctrl + Alt + F</td>
      <td>Extract Field</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most of the refactoring shortcuts are ctrl + alt + <em>some command</em>. If you want to learn
one shortcut only, remember the the first one. That shortcut (alt + enter) will allow
for a lot of functionality that is built-in to the editor.</p>
