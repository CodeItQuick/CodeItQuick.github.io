<h1 id="why-story-pointing-is-evil">Why Story Pointing Is Evil</h1>

<h2 id="introduction--problem-statement">Introduction &amp; Problem Statement</h2>
<p>One of the problems with talking about story pointing, is that its very much two points of opposing views with no clear “right” answer. 
I also cannot think of any science that would show they are either “good” or “bad”. All the same I’m going to attempt to bring you to my point
of view. Not only are story points not useful, they downright contribute to a toxic work environment.</p>

<p>At the core I very much think its garbage in &gt; garbage out. I cannot estimate even my nearest task, and asking me to estimate tasks that I haven’t looked at/etc. are even less accurate. 
I’ve also done pointing poker. Maybe you can rate stories against each other, but I very much have my doubts. If the underlying problem is if you give me a task and I cannot tell you how 
long or difficult it is (really you want how long, and hide it with “complexity”), then there is no activity that makes it more accurate.</p>

<p>I think to the manager you are doing something like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A takes 3 days</li>
  <li>B takes 3 days</li>
  <li>C takes 3 days</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore we will be done in 9 days. However, from my point of view all of these estimates are wildly wrong. So I don’t see what you get out of me going “this will take 3 days”, and you get 
even less adding the values -&gt; you are just summing 3 values that are essentially made up.</p>

<p>It also sets up a weird game that the developer all the sudden has a self interest in playing. Pretend that the developer believes the above estimates are accurate. Its in his best interests to tell management:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A takes 5 days</li>
  <li>B takes 5 days</li>
  <li>C takes 5 days</li>
</ol>

<p>All the sudden the manager thinks there’s 15 days of work. However, if I go and do the work in the 9 days I think it’ll take, I’m a “hero”.</p>

<h2 id="game-theory-on-the-situation">Game Theory On the Situation</h2>

<p>The game theory matrix you have just entered into is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Manager \ Developer</th>
      <th>Developer Sandbags All Estimates</th>
      <th>Developer Does Not Sandbag</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Manager polices estimates</td>
      <td>(A) Developers ability to get away with sandbagging determines performance</td>
      <td>(B) Developer has even lower storypoints, likely viewed as having performance problems</td>
      <td>Toxic Culture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Manager does not police estimates</td>
      <td>(C) Developer gets away with sandbagging, has superior performance</td>
      <td>(D) Developer has lower storypoints, potentially lower than coworkers</td>
      <td>Not-Toxic Culture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Result</td>
      <td>Superior Developer Performance</td>
      <td>Inferior Developer Performance</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Looking at the matrix, there are no “good” results in being in the “not sandbagging your estimates” column for the developer. Either you have on-par performance, or low performance.
In the sandbagging column, you either get superior performance as the manager doesn’t push back against storypoint enough, or frequent arguments with management but your
productivity is higher. From the managers point of view, if he starts policing estimates he essentially creates a toxic environment (either he argues with sandbagging devs, or
thinks non-sandbagging devs are extremely unproductive).</p>

<p>There is a natural flow from state-to-state here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Developer gives honest answers to storypoints, life is good (Quadrant D)</li>
  <li>Another developer starts sandbagging his estimates for <em>reasons</em></li>
  <li>Developer starts to have lower performance than coworkers, enters into lower performance (Quadrant B)</li>
  <li>Developer realizes he needs to sandbag estimates, starts sandbagging (Quadrant C)</li>
  <li>Manager eventually realizes developer is sandbagging, starts to argue with dev about sandbagging (Quadrant A)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here we can enter into several different states, some of them will be steady-state:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manager stops policing dev, dev stops sandbagging (Quadrant D, start at 1)</li>
  <li>Manager stops policing dev, dev continues sandbagging (Quadrant C steady-state, manager has no incentive to police dev (results in toxicity), and developer has no incentive to not sandbag (right column is worse than left))</li>
  <li>Manager continues to police dev, dev stops sandbagging (Quadrant B - extremely undesirable for dev, start at #3, except the dev cannot move to #4 until some time passes)</li>
  <li>Manager continues to police dev, dev continues sandbagging (Quadrant A steady state)</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice the manager’s choices in the current state of affairs. The longer the manager polices the developer, the longer they stay in toxicity essentially (notice the quadrant choices in this scenario
are A or B). Therefore, the manager should realize his mistake, and stop policing the developer. If the manager doesn’t realize he is the cause, the developer is likely fired (either the dev
sandbags his estimates, is confrontational, and is fired. Or, the developer doesn’t sandbag his estimates, has low performance, and is fired).</p>

<p>Notice the developers choices - he either continues to sandbag (Quadrants A/C) or stops (Quadrants B/D). If he stops arguing, he enters into the right side of the matrix (his locus of control is in being in quadrants A/C vs B/D). 
Therefore, the developer should continue to argue his case.</p>

<h2 id="some-revisions-to-the-original-problem-statement">Some Revisions to the Original Problem Statement</h2>

<p>To revise my made-up scenario one more time. If I think something is going to take 3 days, and I say 5 days, the reality is things rarely take as long as I think they’ll take. So I will regularly
not hit my own internal 3 day target, and thus its very hard to “detect” that I’m sandbagging the entire time. Since you cannot detect my sandbagging easily, its more about how many points I can get
away with giving every task you give me.</p>

<p>And one last revision - juniors both don’t understand the above as they don’t have the work experience to have experienced the toxic environment this causes AND they will naturally under-estimate their
tasks. The ones who get hit the hardest with “storypointing” are essentially the juniors - they are both in the wrong part of the matrix, too ignorant to realize the game they are playing is win-lose,
and lack the confidence to speak out against the system.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These last two paragraphs are why I think estimating is essentially toxic. If the dev understands the game you have just entered him into, he’s going to start sandbagging every task. The manager 
eventually realizes this, and starts making him have to justify his estimates. This will especially happen if you start tying story points to performance.</p>
