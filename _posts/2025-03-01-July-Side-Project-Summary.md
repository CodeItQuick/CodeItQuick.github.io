Based on the AI-generated work summaries for July 2025, here's what CodeItQuick worked on:
Major Focus Areas in July 2025:
1. JavaScript/TypeScript Kata Project (Primary Focus - Most of July)
   The entire month was dominated by building a comprehensive kata practice system with mutation testing:
   StarCraft-inspired Unit System: Developed a game simulation with units including:
   Zergling, Marine, and Zealot classes
   Unit interactions with attack/hurt methods using adapter pattern
   Upgradeable armor and weapons system
   Hit points, close units tracking, and battle mechanics
   Mutation Testing Infrastructure: Major focus on test quality:
   Integrated Stryker Mutator for mutation testing
   Achieved 100% code coverage
   Built automated system to analyze mutation test results
   Created tooling to suggest new test names based on uncovered mutations
   Developed scripts to read mutation JSON and generate missing tests
   Coding Agents for Test Generation: Innovative automation:
   Built agents that analyze mutation testing results for bugs
   Automated test case suggestion based on mutation survivors
   Created workflow to write missing tests automatically
   Analyzed coverage data to improve test quality
   Multiple Kata Exercises: Developed several kata challenges:
   Hello World generator kata
   Shopping cart kata (calculating totals with discounts and state tax)
   StarCraft battle simulation kata
   TypeScript Migration: Converted the project to TypeScript with proper configuration and testing setup
2. Weather MCP Server (Late July)
   Started a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server project:
   First commit of weather MCP server running on stdio
   Set up initial project structure with proper module configuration
   Established foundation for MCP-based weather services
3. ESLint Automation Script (End of July)
   Created tooling for dependency management:
   Built script to keep dependencies up to date using ESLint
   Automated linting and formatting with Stylish formatter
   Auto-updates .eslintrc.json with new rule definitions for broken rules
   Key Themes:
   Test Quality & Automation: The dominant theme was pushing test quality to the extreme with mutation testing and building intelligent agents to automatically improve test coverage.
   Game Development: Continued the StarCraft-themed development from previous months, but shifted to a kata/practice system rather than a playable game.
   Tooling & Developer Experience: Built multiple automation tools for linting, testing, and code generation to improve development workflow.
   TypeScript Adoption: Successfully migrated kata project to TypeScript with full tooling support.
   July 2025 showed CodeItQuick's deep focus on software quality practices, particularly around mutation testing and automated test generation—a sophisticated approach to ensuring code correctness beyond traditional code coverage metrics.
