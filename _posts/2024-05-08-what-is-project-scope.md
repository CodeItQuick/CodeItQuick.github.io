What is project scope?

A lot of the time "project scope" is the entire definition used for the relative "size" of 
a project. But in software development, what is "scope" actually comprised of? Some things that
work into your scope are decisions regarding:

1. Programming Language Choice
2. Tech Stack Choice
3. Project Definition
4. Problem Complexity
5. Likelihood of Motivation
6. How "polished" a look is acceptable
7. Number of Features
8. Architecture -> more ironed our architecture can add boilerplate, the boilerplate can be useful
9. How many good vs bad software decisions you make
10. Testing -> it actually mostly reduces complexity, but initially there is a cost
11. How usable the product is -> building a button that has no function
12. Amount of refactoring you're willing to do/How messy are you ok the code being
13. How often are you willing to redesign the project from an architecture point of view
14. How often are you willing to redesign the project from a product point of view
