# Key Insights:
Q1 2025 Pattern (Jan-Mar): January was completely inactive, followed by a slow ramp-up in February and March working on a C# cab fleet management system. This suggests:  
Possible extended holiday break in January  
Gradual return to coding in February  
Focus on enterprise C# development in Q1  
Activity Acceleration: The year shows a clear pattern of increasing activity:  
Q1: Minimal/low activity  
Q2: Mixed activity levels  
Q3: Explosive growth in productivity, especially September  
September Peak: September 2025 was by far the most productive month with 111 commits focused on building the Git MCP Server - the very tool we're using now to analyze this history!  
January 2025 appears to have been a complete break from coding, which is quite common for the holiday season and new year period.
