# Let's Estimate Our Developer Pain

## **1. Introduction**
Developers are rife with stories about late projects. Management’s unreasonable expectations combine with developers' 
struggles to code vague requirements. There are many common problems with estimation. Yet, what are some of the benefits? 
We’ll go into the rewards of the estimation process. We are attempting to remove the divide between managers and developers.

## **2. The Pain's of Estimation**

### It's A Common Pain Point
It's very difficult to estimate individual developer tasks, stories, and project timelines. A natural gap exists between 
the promise of a feature and the delivery. This gap causes pain between the parties. As my career progresses, this pain 
has reduced. The main reason it's become easier is that I'm better at building software.

### Minimizing The Pain
The goal of estimating is to better manage expectations. Now, is this the right viewpoint for delivering software? I'm
not so sure. Software developers must show continual progress in the software's development. Still, there is major pain 
in time estimation for developers. Missed hard deadlines are the biggest pain point. What are some ways we can remove 
this pain, beyond "being a better developer"?

### Beyond Our Control
The factors we cannot control can be the most discouraging. A task that is repetitive and routine, not complex, and 
standardized would be easy to estimate. If we added a lot of historical data to this repetitive task, we could estimate 
how long it will take. Unfortunately, these tasks resemble an old car assembly line. Software development tasks are not 
repetitive and routine.

### The Ideal Task
Stories dependent on each other will slow down development. These dependent stories make for a waterfall process. 
The goal is fitting independent stories. We want small pull requests that are easy to review and merge. Independent 
scoped work enables parallelized tasks. To succeed, make sure the ask is well-defined.

### Complicating Factors
If what we are working on is complex and novel, that is going to bring many challenges. Novel or innovative tasks make 
development even more challenging. There is often a creative element to development. Finding ways to reduce complexity 
is not simple. Keep it novel, but avoid the complexity.

### Scope, Uncertainty, And Shifting Priorities
Finally, we should cut project risk or uncertainty. A typical mitigation strategy would be to use familiar tech while 
avoiding new tech. We have to avoid tasks that shift in their goals or lack the clarity needed. These tasks increase the 
likelihood of unnecessary rework.

### Collaboration Issues
There are challenges inherent in collaboration, especially with external parties. External customer meetings are necessary 
throughout the project. It's common for projects to need high coordination. There is no replacement for good working 
relationships.  

## **4. Rewards: Benefits of Estimation**

### Encourages Team Collaboration and Shared Understanding
Estimating has led to product discussions with developers about scope and requirements. Acceptance testing is another 
method to create these discussions. Estimation may be a welcome side effect while developing a shared understanding.

### Identifies Risks and Unknowns Early
Identifying risks upfront or as early as possible is important. Funny enough, XP and Scrum somewhat disagree on requirements 
gathering. XP believes requirements are more incremental. Scrum believes a large part of tasks is estimable. From what 
I've seen, the latter is a bit of a pipe dream. Still, the truth lies between these two statements.

### Helps Manage Scope Creep
Scope in general is something I've been thinking about more lately. How do we identify all parts of this epic, story, or 
ticket, so we don't end up in the trap of ever-expanding scope creep? I've been the guy who picked up "one task" from 
the backlog. It turned out to be a lot of work to install it in every library that needs the change. I've seen overruns 
in general features countless times as well. The cause is not believing the engineers' honest estimates.

## **5. Conclusion**

As a previous business analyst, I found the most value in discussions about metrics. Time estimates result in similar 
discussions. The answer is to learn with the business how to develop the feature. So use time estimation as an aide for 
development.
