# Let's Estimate Our Developer Pain

## **1. Introduction**
Developers are rife with stories about late projects. Management often have unreasonable expectations, while developers 
struggle to code vague requirements. We'll first talk about general problems with estimation. We'll go into some of the 
benefits and rewards of the estimation process. Decreasing this divide between managers and developers will be beneficial.

## **2. The Pain's of Estimation**

### It's A Common Pain Point
It's very difficult to estimate individual developer tasks, stories, and project timelines. A natural gap exists between 
when I promise to deliver the feature and the actual delivery date. As my career progresses, this pain has gotten to be 
less and less. The main reason it's become easier is that I'm better at building software.

### Minimizing The Pain
The goal of estimation is to improve customer satisfaction by better managing expectations. Now, is this the right 
viewpoint for delivering software? I'm not so sure. Software developers must show continual progress in the software's 
development. Still, there is major pain in time estimation for developers. Missed hard deadlines are the biggest pain 
point. What are some ways we can remove this pain, beyond "being a better developer"?

## **3. Solutions Resulting From Estimation**

### Beyond Our Control
The factors we cannot control can be the most discouraging. A task that is repetitive and routine, not complex, and 
standardized would be easy to estimate. If we added a lot of historical data to this repetitive task, we could estimate 
how long it will take. Unfortunately, these tasks resemble an old car assembly line. Software development tasks are not 
repetitive and routine.

### The Ideal Task
Stories dependent on each other will slow down development. These dependent stories make for a waterfall process. 
Independent stories should be the goal. We want small pull requests that are easy to review and merge. Independent scoped 
work enables parallelized tasks. Making sure the ask is well-defined will further help the developer do the job.

### Complicating Factors
If what we are working on is complex and novel, that is going to bring many challenges. Novel or innovative tasks make 
development even more challenging. There is often a creative element to development. Finding ways to reduce complexity 
is not simple. These factors can cause high demands on learning.

### Scope, Uncertainty, And Shifting Priorities
Finally, we should cut project risk or uncertainty. A typical mitigation strategy would be to use familiar tech while 
avoiding new tech. We have to avoid tasks that shift in their goals or lack the clarity needed to begin the work. These 
tasks increase the likelihood of unnecessary rework.

### Collaboration Issues
There are challenges inherent in collaboration, especially with external parties. We must have external customer meetings 
throughout the project. It's common for projects to need high coordination. Tasks must be independent; otherwise, 
developers will interfere with each other.

## **4. Rewards: Benefits of Estimation**

### Encourages Team Collaboration and Shared Understanding
Estimating has led to product discussions with developers about scope and requirements. Acceptance testing is another 
method to create these discussions. Estimation may be a welcome side effect while developing a shared understanding.

### Identifies Risks and Unknowns Early
Identifying risks upfront or as early as possible is important. Funny enough, XP and Scrum somewhat disagree on requirements 
gathering. XP believes requirements are more incremental. Scrum believes a large part of tasks is estimable. From what 
I've seen, the latter is a bit of a pipe dream. Still, the truth lies between these two statements.

### Helps Manage Scope Creep
Scope in general is something I've been thinking about more lately. How do we identify all parts of this epic, story, or 
ticket, so we don't end up in the trap of ever-expanding scope creep? I've been the guy who picked up "one task" from 
the backlog. It turned out to be a lot of work to install it in every library that needs the change. I've seen overruns 
in general features countless times as well. The cause is not believing the engineers' honest estimates.

## **5. Conclusion**

As a previous business analyst, I found the most value in discussions about metrics. Time estimates result in similar 
discussions. The answer is to learn with the business how to develop the feature. So use time estimation as an aide for 
development.
