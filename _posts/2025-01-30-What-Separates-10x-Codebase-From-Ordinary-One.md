# Introduction: The Myth of the 10x Developer vs. The Reality of the 10x Codebase

Attributing the speed of a developer to that developer alone is a myth. Put a very fast developer into a slow codebase, 
and he’ll code slow. The only time these two factors meet is a fast developer in a codebase and an environment he can 
excel in. The biggest form factor available to coders is the codebase they work in. Having a codebase that is well 
maintained and easy to make changes is a worthwhile pursuit. It allows for everyone working in it to work faster despite 
their current ability level. What kind of elements in a codebase cause a developer to slow down? If I have to edit behaviour 
in four places before it is “live” to the customer is one obvious case. The inverse of this is also true. Clumsy abstractions 
make it difficult to get features out. Devops is another major factor to the speed a developer works in. So what defines 
a codebase to be 10x versus 0.1x besides the nebulous and controversial “clean code”.

# The Core Traits of a 10x Codebase

## Readability & Simplicity: The Foundation of a Scalable Codebase

The mark of an exceptional coder is that the code is easy to understand his code. They also understand the original intention 
of coding something a particular way. Often people expect the opposite. A smarter coders code is so exceptional noone 
else can understand it. The mark of “genius” is actually “extreme simplicity” not “overt complexity”.

## Maintainability: Code That Can Evolve Without Breaking

What does developing faster actually look like? Code that can change easily when presented with a new idea is the mark 
of a very good codebase. These codebases enable  consistent and dependabe addition of features. It’s not enough to push 
a new feature that works 85% of the time. The reality is even a 15% “not working” is a significant bug to the end user, 
especially given enough traffic.

# Developer Experience: A Codebase Engineers Love Working With

Developer experience can be a tough sell to the business. New language features and framework features are often targeted 
at developer productivity. The new features in the language itself allow for simpler expression of ideas.  Framework 
developments can improve factors including website performance. Its a “free upgrade” given you can upgrade to the newer 
version of the tooling.

# Automation & Tooling: Reducing Manual Effort

Developer’s control over their IDE and tools can result in huge productivity gains. Understanding refactoring shortcuts 
speed up developers and increase maintainability. Tests ensure that the code works to the new requirements. Introducing 
automation lowers the manual effort in maintaining the code. This general flow  speeds up the team overall.

Performance & Scalability: Code That Grows With the Business

Codebases have to be fast and scalable once sales have begun. Its important that despite the data size of the customers it doesn’t affect their experience. The application is architected based on data needs.

The Pitfalls of an Ordinary (or 0.1x) Codebase

The “Ship Fast, Fix Later” Mentality

Quick fixes within a codebase can be some of the most guilty solutions of poor abstractions. It is faster to get the feature out than make the code maintainable in the process. It is possible to get the feature out, and then later clean things up later.

Over-Engineering & Unnecessary Abstractions

A more maintainable solution will often look “over engineered”. The problem with over-engineering is in the beginning. Premature optimization can run rampant. Often we don’t understand the problem enough early on. Good abstractions are created by duplicate functions.

Poor Documentation & Tribal Knowledge

Poor documentation and tribal knowledge being necessary is a code smell. It shows the existing codebase, variable names, and class names do not describe the intent. Tests can act as a double re-assurance that the original intention is correct.

How to Turn an Ordinary Codebase Into a 10x Codebase

Start With Small, Incremental Improvements

Refactoring as we go is a key to keeping a codebase in at least as good a state as the current developers will allow. Improving the ability of the developers to produce readable, testable code.

Invest in Developer Productivity

Teach developers new ways of collaborative working. Introduce concepts such as pair programming, and ensembling. This better communication is the real benefit of these changes.

Make Code Quality a Team-Wide Priority

Realizing the benefit of high quality code has to be a high priority. Testing is often a focal point that allow developers to rally around automation. The more automated testing the quicker the team can release.

Conclusion: The Competitive Advantage of a 10x Codebase

The advantage of a 10x codebase is it aides developers in creating solutions. Do not let your competitors win this battle.
