# The Basics (TDD Year 1)
   
My first main takeaway was tests need to be:

1. Fast (< 10 ms, <150ms if database integration is involved)    
2. Isolated  
3. Concise.  

TDD is done through Red/Green/Refactor.  

# Learning The Practice (TDD Year 2->3.5)  

What does good code look like?  
What is ensemble programming?  
Test Data Builders and Test Factories  
Jetbrains Editor Shortcuts and Why They Are Important  

# Spreading the Practice (3.5 -> 5 Years)  

The Importance of Coding Dojos  
Implementing Strong Style Pair Programming  
Implementing Ensemble Programming  
TODO: Teaching others the mechanics  
The Importance of Acceptance Testing
