# Shortcutting your jetbrains (Windows only)

## General Search Window Shortcuts

The general search window is very useful and can be displayed by using shift + shift.
There are shortcuts to go to each individual tab as detailed below.

| Shortcut       | Function                                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Double Click Shift | Search Window |
| Ctrl + N | Go to Class |
| Ctrl + Shift + N | Go To Files |
| Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N | Go To Symbols |

## Basic Editor Moving Around
Moving around in the editor, these shortcuts are used frequently. The goto error
and previous error is especially useful to find compile errors. Its also possible
to jump between methods.

| Shortcut       | Function                                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl + B  | Go to Declarations or Usages |
| Alt + Up | Previous Method |
| Alt + Down | Next Method |
| F2 | Go to Next Error |
| Shift + F2 | Go To Previous Error |

## Goto by Reference Actions
I use goto declaration or usage frequently, and need to start trying some of the other shortcuts in here more frequently.

| Shortcut       | Function                                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Alt + Home | Jump to Navigation Bar |
| Ctrl + B | Go to Declaration or Usages |
| Ctrl + Alt + B | Go to Implementations |
| Ctrl + Shift + B | Go To Type Declaration | 
| Ctrl + Shift + T | Go To Test |
| Ctrl + F12 | File Structure |
| Ctrl + Alt + F12 | File Path |
