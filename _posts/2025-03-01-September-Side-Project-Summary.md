Based on the AI-generated work summaries for September 2025, here's what CodeItQuick worked on:
Major Focus Areas in September 2025:
1. Git MCP Server Development (Primary Focus)
   The majority of September was spent building and enhancing a Git MCP (Model Context Protocol) server:
   Core Git Operations: Implemented multiple endpoints including:
   get-commit-message-logs - retrieve commit history
   get-commit-patch-logs - analyze file changes
   get-file-content - view file contents
   get-directory-filenames - explore project structure
   GitHub Integration & Batch Processing: Developed adapter patterns for GitHub data synchronization with MongoDB, including:
   Commit data retrieval and storage
   Commit diff processing
   Content fetching from repositories
   Rate limit error handling
   Testing Infrastructure: Added comprehensive test coverage for batch processors, GitHub suppliers, and various adapters using Mocha and Chai
   Documentation: Created extensive use-case documentation and README files explaining how to use the MCP server
2. Request Library Migration Project
   Worked on a wrapper/adapter pattern for migrating from the deprecated request library to axios:
   Created MakeHttp class with multiple adapter methods
   Implemented authentication endpoints (login functionality)
   Built Vue + Express demo applications
   Added comprehensive tests for different HTTP patterns
3. Chess/Stafford Gambit Application (Early September)
   Developed a chess training application focused on the Stafford Gambit:
   Built a Stafford engine that knows various trap lines
   Implemented hint system for players
   Added undo functionality and game state management
   Set up Jest testing with coverage reporting
   Created Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend using Vite
   The month showed a clear progression from chess application work (early September) to the request library migration project (mid-September) to intensive Git MCP server development (late September), which became the primary focus with extensive feature additions, testing, and documentation.
