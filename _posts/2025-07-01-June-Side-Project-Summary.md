Based on the AI-generated work summaries for June 2025, here's what CodeItQuick worked on:
Work in June 2025:
Very Limited Activity - Only 2 commits in June, showing minimal development work during this month.
Next.js Project Initialization (Mid-June)
Started a new Next.js application project:
Initial Setup (June 15):
Created initial Next.js project using Create Next App
Set up basic Next.js configuration
Added standard .gitignore for Next.js projects
Included initial documentation and deployment references for Vercel
Dependency Addition (June 17):
Added several new dependencies to package.json
Created a new modules directory structure
Set up files for the newly added dependencies
Key Observation:
June 2025 was an extremely quiet month for CodeItQuick with only 2 commits total:
June 15: Project initialization
June 17: Adding dependencies and module structure
This represents a significant drop in activity compared to other months. The work suggests the beginning of a new Next.js project, but development didn't progress much further during June. This could indicate:
Vacation or time off
Focus on other non-coding activities
Planning phase for the new project
Work on other repositories not captured in this data
The contrast is stark when compared to July-September where CodeItQuick had extensive activity with dozens of commits per month on various projects (Kata systems, Git MCP server, PatternCraft, etc.).
